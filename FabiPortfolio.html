            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hello world (or whoever is reading this)! My name is Fabian Gutierrez and I'm hoping to break into the tech industry. I worked for 6 years in construction, specifically concrete, so I'm no stranger to hard work.
                When I'm not learning to code I'm out being active either playing soccer, volleyball or just going for a hike.
            </p>

            <h2>Online Reputation Management</h2>
            <p>
                The web is full of opinions, and some of these can be negative. Social media allows anyone with an internet connection to say whatever they want about your business. Online Reputation Management gives you the control over what potential customers see when they search for your business.

            <h2>Social Media Marketing</h2>
            <p>
                Social media continues to have a sizable influence on buying habits. Social media marketing helps you determine which platforms are suited to your brand, using analytics to find the right markets and increase your lead generation.

                As the search ranking for your business increases, your advertising costs decrease, and you no longer need to advertise your page.
