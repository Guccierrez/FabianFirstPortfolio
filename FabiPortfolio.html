            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Console.log(Hello world (or whoever is reading this))! My name is Fabian Gutierrez and I'm hoping to break into the tech industry. I worked for 6 years in construction, specifically concrete, so I'm no stranger to hard work.
                When I'm not learning to code I'm out being active either playing soccer, volleyball or just going for a hike. Hopefully by end the end of this course I will have put in enough work to consider myself a full-stack developer.
                In the meantime this portfolio will have to do.
